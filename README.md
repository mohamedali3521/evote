An online voting system with Aadhar for Indian election is proposed in this project. The 
proposed model has a greater security in the sense that voter high security password is 
confirmed before the vote is accepted in the main database of Election Commission of India. 
The additional feature of the model is that the voter can confirm if his/her vote has gone to 
correct candidate/party. In this model a person can also vote from outside of his/her allotted 
constituency or from his/her preferred location. In the proposed system the tallying of the votes 
will be done automatically, thus saving a huge time and enabling Election Commissioner of 
India to announce the result within a very short period.
